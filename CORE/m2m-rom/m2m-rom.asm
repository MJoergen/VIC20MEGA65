; VIC 20 for MEGA65 (VIC20MEGA65) QNICE ROM
;
; Main program that is used to build m2m-rom.rom by make-rom.sh.
; The ROM is loaded by qnice.vhd
;
; The execution starts at the label START_FIRMWARE.

; ****************************************************************************

; If the define RELEASE is defined, then the ROM will be a self-contained and
; self-starting ROM that includes the Monitor (QNICE "operating system") and
; jumps to START_FIRMWARE. In this case it is assumed, that the firmware is
; located in ROM and the variables are located in RAM.
;
; If RELEASE is not defined, then it is assumed that we are in the develop and
; debug mode so that the firmware runs in RAM and can be changed/loaded using
; the standard QNICE Monitor mechanisms such as "M/L" or QTransfer.

; SUBMENU_SUMMARY callback function:

; "headline" / starting point of any submenu in config.vhd: You are able to
; change the standard semantics when it comes to summarizing the status of the
; very submenu that is meant by the "headline" / starting point.
;
; Input:
;   R8: pointer to the string that includes the "%s"
;   R9: pointer to the menu item within the M2M$CFG_OPTM_GROUPS structure
;  R10: end-of-menu-marker: if R9 == R10: we reached end of the menu structure
; Output:

;       string pointer to completely new headline (do not modify/re-use R8)
;   R9, R10: unchanged
